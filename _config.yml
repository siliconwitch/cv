  Hi, my name is Raj, and I'm Chief Engineer of Wearable Systems at Silicon Witchery. I've previously worked for companies big and small, focusing largely on <mark>consumer wearables</mark>, and <mark>IoT products</mark>.

  Over the years I've been involved in end-to-end product development. From drawing specifications with customers to the factory floor ensuring correct assembly. I've also worked closely with technology partners and EMC test facilities to ensure our products have been fully verified before launch.

  I'm an embedded systems engineer that loves to build hardware and write code. But my experience in end-to-end product development gives me the edge to see the bigger picture. I always strive to build the best for the business and value good communication to keep things running smoothly.
