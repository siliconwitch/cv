    During my time at UWE, I learnt advanced skills in <mark>Model Based Design</mark> and <mark>DSP</mark> algorithms. These skills I then immediately applied to my Masters Thesis Project which then went on to be featured in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/07/12/independent-wheel-drive-rc-car/" target="_blank">Hackaday</a> magazine, and gain <a href="https://youtu.be/ET1HEyqEQJQ" target="_blank">25,000 views</a> on YouTube.
    
    I also had the opportunity to arrange field trips with course mates, to meet engineering teams behind such projects as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound_LSR" target="_blank">Bloodhound Land Speed Record Vehicle</a>.

    UoB taught me essential skills in teamwork and leadership. It also taught me the appreciation to explore science and pursuit of knowledge. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    In my free time, I also helped with various societies and raced in the British Karting Championship, though I never quite made it to Formula 1.
