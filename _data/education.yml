    UoB taught me essential skills in <mark>Teamwork</mark> and <mark>Leadership</mark>. It also taught me the appreciation to explore science and pursuit of knowledge. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    In my free time, I helped with various university clubs and also raced on the regional go-karting team. Though I never quite made it to Formula 1.
