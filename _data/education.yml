    During my time at UWE, I learnt advanced skills in <mark>Model Based Design</mark> and <mark>DSP</mark>. These skills I then immediately applied to my Masters Thesis Project which went on to be featured in [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2014/07/12/independent-wheel-drive-rc-car/) and [25,000 views](https://youtu.be/ET1HEyqEQJQ) on YouTube.
    
    I also had the opportunity to arrange field trips with coursemates, meeting companies and teams such as the crew behind the (Bloodhoud Land Speed Record Vehicle)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound_LSR].

    UoB taught me essential skills in teamwork and leadership. It also taught me the appreciation to explore science and persue knowledge which without, I would not have found myself where I am today. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    During my time here, I also participated in the Mountaineering club, raced for the 125cc British Karting Championship and DJ'd at various Heavy Metal bars with the Dean of Chemistery, who was about as wild as you can imagine.
