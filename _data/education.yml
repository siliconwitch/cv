    During my time at UWE, I learnt advanced skills in model based design and control theory. These skills I then immediately applied to my Masters Thesis Project which then went on to be featured on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/07/12/independent-wheel-drive-rc-car/" target="_blank">Hackaday</a>, and gained <a href="https://youtu.be/ET1HEyqEQJQ" target="_blank">25,000 views</a> on YouTube.
    
    I also had the opportunity to arrange field trips and meet the engineering teams behind such projects as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound_LSR" target="_blank">Bloodhound Land Speed Record Vehicle</a>.

    UoB taught me essential skills in teamwork and leadership. It also taught me the appreciation to explore science and the pursuit of knowledge.

    In my free time, I helped with various university clubs and raced on the regional go-karting team. Though I never quite made it to Formula 1.
