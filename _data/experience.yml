    At Turnpike I led product development of bespoke smartwatches for professional customers such as Microsoft and H&M. I faced a high pressure startup environment with composure, ensuring product development remained stable during times of business turbulence. When needed, I'd carefully adjusted work to match business needs, ensuring value was being created in the right places and at a high level of quality. This role taught me the lessons to understand different people, bring their opinions together and truly operate a business.

    At BRL, I engineered position sensors for robotic arms that needed to function in the absence of gravity, under the strong radiation of space and in close proximity to nearby astronauts operating the machine. Heavy use of model based design was required to research brand new sensor fusion techniques, and ensure safe, reliable code.
