    I started this project to easily prototype wearable projects without the headache of re-spinning custom hardware and wireless firmware. It has since grown into a company and as have the applications. We are slowly branching out from <mark>fashion</mark>, to <mark>medical</mark>, <mark>rescue</mark> and even <mark>space</mark> applications where our devices look like they'll be making a huge impact to so many innovative products comings soon.
